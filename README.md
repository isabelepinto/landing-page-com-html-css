# landing-page-com-html-css
I just created a landing page for my Discord bot! 
I made an HTML file that it is linked to my community site on Discord. 

This community was created by friends, to help us to connect to others programmers here from our city, Teresina (that's why the community is called "The Devs").

Even if you are not from here, you can join us and we are going to motivate ourselves to study and discuss new subjects.

So check it out, and use the code if you want to do your on landing page!
Have fun :)![Captura de tela de 2022-07-04 09-58-46](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96204193/177169074-e4561013-87de-4df2-bd05-27e09962461f.png)
